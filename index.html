						<div class="fragment" >
							<h3>1. Requirements Elicitation</h3>
						</div>
						<hr class="fragment">
						<p class="fragment" >
							&#x21FE; Is the practice of researching and discovering the requirements of a system 
							from users, customers, and other stakeholders.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							<div class="fragment">
								<h3>2. Requirements Analysis</h3>
							</div>
							<hr class="fragment">
							<p class="fragment"  >
								&#x21FE; Focuses on the tasks that determine the needs or conditions
								to meet the new or altered product or project, taking account of the possibly conflicting
								requirements of the various stakeholders, analyzing, documenting, validating and managing
								software or system requirements.
							</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							<div class="fragment">
								<h3>3. Requirements Documentation</h3>
							</div>
							<hr class="fragment">
							<p class="fragment">
								&#x21FE; In project management describes how each requirement meets the
								business needs for the project. Requirements should be measurable, traceable, consistent,
								complete and acceptable to the stakeholders.
							</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="fragment" >
							<h3>4. Requirements Verification & Validation</h3>
						</div>
						<hr class="fragment">
						<p class="fragment">
							&#x21FE; Are independent procedures that are used together for checking
							that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills
							its intended purpose.

					</section>
					<section data-auto-animate>
